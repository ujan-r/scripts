Here are some shell scripts that (probably) work on my machine.

## Installation

To install all scripts, run:

```sh
# Install all scripts.
. ./install.sh
```

You can also specify specific scripts to be installed:

```sh
# Install foo.
. ./install.sh foo

# Install foo and bar.
. ./install.sh foo bar
```

Uninstallation works similarly:

```sh
# Uninstall all scripts.
. ./uninstall.sh

# Uninstall foo and bar.
. ./uninstall.sh foo bar
```

## License

See the [LICENSE](/LICENSE) file.

Essentially, you're free to do whatever you like with this code. Just
don't sue me :)
